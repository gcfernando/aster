# Aster Numeric Behavior — Decimal Precision, Scientific Expressions and Integer Modes

Aster uses different calculation engines for decimal arithmetic, scientific expressions, fixed-width integers, unit conversion and dates. This reference describes their input limits, rounding, range checks and result reuse so you can choose the appropriate mode.

[Aster overview and setup](../README.md) · [Build and test guide](development.md)

## Choose a precision model

| Mode | Representation | Practical consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Standard | Bounded base-10 `BigDecimal` backed by `BigInteger` | Exact addition, subtraction and multiplication within bounds; division and square root round to 100 significant digits. |
| Scientific | Binary64 `double` | Approximate real-number expressions, with roughly 15 significant decimal digits. |
| Programmer | 8/16/32/64-bit integer word | Arithmetic wraps modulo the word size; signed decimal uses two's complement. |
| Converter | Binary64 factors and offsets | Approximate numeric results with domain and range checks. |
| Dates | Gregorian date-only arithmetic | Calendar dates from year 0001 to 9999, without time zones or daylight-saving adjustments. |

The 100-digit input limit belongs to Standard. It does not increase Scientific or Converter precision. The display-precision preference changes presentation rather than the underlying engine value.

Binary64 normally represents about 15–17 significant decimal digits; this is not a guarantee that every computed result has that accuracy. Rounding, the operation and cancellation can reduce result accuracy, and subnormal values near underflow have lower relative precision. For example, Scientific evaluates `1e16 + 1 - 1e16` as `0` because the intermediate addition loses the `1`; Standard returns exactly `1`. The 3–15 significant display digits control presentation, not a mathematical error bound. See [Microsoft's floating-point numeric reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/floating-point-numeric-types).

## Standard

- Leading zeros do not count toward the 100-digit mantissa limit; entered trailing zeros do. Excess precision is rejected. Pasting a copied result follows the new-input limit; recalling a stored result can exceed it.
- Normalized coefficients are limited to **2,000 digits**, scale to **−1,000 through 2,000**, and nonzero adjusted decimal exponents to **−1,000 through +1,000**. `1e-1000` and `9e1000` are supported. Bounds apply to intermediate and final values; violations produce an error. Exact terminating division results need no padding.
- An explicitly written exponent must itself be an integer from **−1,000 through +1,000**. This input syntax limit is separate from the normalized value range: write `1e1000` instead of `0.1e1001`, and `1e-1000` instead of `10e-1001`. The alternate forms have the same mathematical values but exceed the literal exponent limit.
- Replacing a pending operator does not execute it. Repeated equals repeats the last operation/right operand. `200 − 10 % =` gives `180`; multiplication gives `20`; division gives `2000`.
- Applying percent to a completed standalone result clears the previous repeated operation: `2 + 3 =`, `%`, `=` stays at `0.05`.
- Square, square root, reciprocal and percentage results are complete transformed operands; a new digit replaces them. Changing sign keeps the operand editable, so `5`, `±`, `2` enters `−52`. A new digit after equals starts a calculation. Backspace edits only an editable input; CE preserves a pending operation, while C/Escape resets it.
- Replacing an operator after CE preserves the accumulated left operand: `8 + 9 CE × 3 =` produces `24`; CE followed directly by equals uses zero as the right operand.

## Scientific

- Expressions are limited to **2,048 characters** and **64 recursive levels**. The parser does not execute scripts or dynamically evaluate code.
- Factorial accepts integers **0–170**. `0^0` is rejected; `-2^2` is `-4`, and `2^-2` is `0.25`. Tangent is rejected near singularities when `|cos(angle)| < 10^-14`. Hyperbolic functions are dimensionless.
- Degree inputs to sine, cosine and tangent are reduced modulo 360 before conversion to radians, preserving the phase of large represented angles. Binary64 input rounding still applies; phase already lost while parsing or computing an angle cannot be recovered.
- Angle conversion multiplies by its conversion constant to avoid an intermediate underflow for representable tiny results. A nonzero sine/tangent degree input whose converted angle truly underflows is rejected; cosine can still return one.
- Binary64 rounding, cancellation and subnormal behavior apply. Invalid domains, nonfinite results, overflow and detected underflow produce readable errors.
- Enter reevaluates the current expression. Keypad operators can continue from the last result; keypad numeric input after equals begins a fresh expression. Memory stores the decimal round-trip representation of the approximate result. Out-of-range or underflowing recall into Scientific is rejected.
- Selected operands are preserved and parenthesized by power/factorial keys. Explicit selections made after equals take priority over answer continuation. Scientific keypad edits participate in native text undo, while `Ans` retains the last successful result.

## Programmer

- Parsed out-of-range integers and all results are masked to the chosen width. Division truncates toward zero. Right shift is arithmetic when signed and logical when unsigned.
- Shift counts must be `0..width−1`. Widening sign-extends negative signed values; narrowing masks. Changing width or signedness cancels a pending operation.
- Binary display is grouped in four-bit blocks and padded to the word size. Incomplete input cannot copy a stale result.
- Reused whole-number results accept exponent notation such as `1E+100` through bounded exact decimal parsing before word-width wrapping. Reuse input is limited to 128 characters; exponent notation follows the bounded decimal range above. Nonintegral values are rejected without changing the current word.

## Converter and Dates

- Valid identity conversions preserve the input after domain validation. Offset-free conversions use a direct scale ratio to avoid unnecessary intermediate overflow/underflow.
- Factors distinguish the international foot/pound, thermochemical calorie, BTU (IT), mechanical/metric horsepower, and US/Imperial volume. A Julian year is exactly 365.25 days. A small negative base-temperature value caused by offset cancellation is clamped to absolute zero within four machine epsilons of the input offset; Kelvin input below zero is rejected.
- Conversion definitions are checked against independently stated [NIST SI conversion references](https://www.nist.gov/pml/special-publication-811/nist-guide-si-appendix-b-conversion-factors/nist-guide-si-appendix-b8), the [BIPM SI brochure](https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure) and [binary-prefix definitions](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html). The acre uses the international foot; historical survey-foot acres are a different unit. Temperature conversions apply to absolute temperatures, including scale offsets, rather than temperature intervals.
- Date differences are absolute and elapsed by default; inclusive counting adds one day. Interval adjustment applies years, then months, then weeks/days, clamping at each year/month boundary.

## Result display

Results are selectable and read-only. Text fits and wraps; previous/next digit pages expose any remaining characters without scrollbars. Selecting text copies that selection; **Copy result** and history-card copy buttons preserve the complete stored value. Long expression captions may be abbreviated.

Scientific and Converter copy/history use round-trip (`G17`) values. Standard memory and history retain the full bounded decimal result, including results longer than the limit for a new input. Recalling a value and pasting its text therefore follow different input rules.

Scientific and Converter display formatting retains the requested significant digits even when a tiny nonzero value cannot be represented exactly by `decimal`. Numeric input accepts complete native leading/exponent signs, including bidirectional sign sequences. Scientific expressions still exclude grouping and spaces within exponents.

If a locale reports the same decimal and grouping separator, Aster treats it as decimal and suppresses grouping in formatted output. Multiple occurrences in a mantissa are rejected before invariant fallback rather than guessed as a grouped integer.

See [the development guide](development.md#run-the-engine-and-persistence-tests) for the test command. A passing engine suite does not independently validate every displayed control or physical-input route; those need the component and interactive checks described there.
